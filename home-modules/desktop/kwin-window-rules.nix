# KWin Window Rules Transformer
#
# This module transforms the machine-specific window rules exported by plasma-rc2nix
# to use canonical activity UUIDs and paths defined in project-activities/data.nix.
#
# Problem: plasma-rc2nix exports window rules with system-generated activity UUIDs
# that differ between machines (e.g., 6ed332bc-fa61-5381-511d-4d5ba44a293b).
#
# Solution: This transformer:
# 1. Imports canonical activity definitions from data.nix (single source of truth)
# 2. Imports raw rules from generated/plasma-rc2nix.nix (unchanged by exports)
# 3. Builds UUID and path mappings
# 4. Transforms each rule to use canonical UUIDs and expanded paths
# 5. For PWA rules: Replaces title-based matching with WM class matching
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Edit KDE window rules via GUI
# 2. Run: scripts/plasma-rc2nix.sh > home-modules/desktop/generated/plasma-rc2nix.nix
# 3. Rebuild: sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<target>
# 4. Rules automatically use canonical UUIDs from data.nix
